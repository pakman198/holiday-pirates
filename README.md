# Holiday Pirates


**Context**
The app shows a button that once clicked fetches data from an API and displays it on a list. Each element of the list has a button that once clicked fetches additional information and displays the results on a new list


### Instructions

  - run `npm install`
  - run `npm start`
  
The challenge also required that the app worked on IE10.
To be able to view the app on IE10 do as follows:
  - run `npm build`
  - once the process is finished, add the contents of the build folder to a web server or deploy them on a node static server:
    - `npm install -g serve`
    - `serve -s build`
